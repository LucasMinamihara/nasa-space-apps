            <p>In this project, we will show you how to solve the problems encountered in space. </p>
            <p>To facilitate, we will use the data provided by <b> NASA</b> itself and show each situation that can
                occur in the
                life of a living being outside the terrestrial environment.</p>
            <p>To make it even more realistic, we will allow users to be able to interact with the character showing
                situations that he may come across and how to solve a certain problem.</p>

        <h3>Radiation</h3>
        <p>The first hazard of a human mission to Mars is also the most difficult to visualize because, well, space
            radiation is invisible to the human eye. Radiation is not only stealthy, but considered one of the most
            menacing of the five hazards.</p>
        <p>Above Earth’s natural protection, radiation exposure increases cancer risk, damages the central nervous
            system, can alter cognitive function, reduce motor function and prompt behavioral changes. To learn what can
            happen above low-Earth orbit, NASA studies how radiation affects biological samples using a ground-based
            research laboratory.</p>
        <p>The space station sits just within Earth’s protective magnetic field, so while our astronauts are exposed to
            ten-times higher radiation than on Earth, it’s still a smaller dose than what deep space has in store.</p>
        <p>To mitigate this hazard, deep space vehicles will have significant protective shielding, dosimetry, and
            alerts. Research is also being conducted in the field of medical countermeasures such as pharmaceuticals to
            help defend against radiation.</p>
        <p class="esc">ESC TO LEAVE</p>
    </div>
    <div class="modal isolation hidden">
        <h3>Isolation and confinement</h3>
        <p>Behavioral issues among groups of people crammed in a small space over a long period of time, no matter how
            well trained they are, are inevitable. Crews will be carefully chosen, trained and supported to ensure they
            can work effectively as a team for months or years in space.</p>
        <p>On Earth we have the luxury of picking up our cell phones and instantly being connected with nearly
            everything and everyone around us. On a trip to Mars, astronauts will be more isolated and confined than we
            can imagine. Sleep loss, circadian desynchronization, and work overload compound this issue and may lead to
            performance decrements, adverse health outcomes, and compromised mission objectives.</p>
        <p>To address this hazard, methods for monitoring behavioral health and adapting/refining various tools and
            technologies for use in the spaceflight environment are being developed to detect and treat early risk
            factors. Research is also being conducted in workload and performance, light therapy for circadian
            alignment, phase shifting and alertness. </p>
        <p class="esc">ESC TO LEAVE</p>
    </div>
    <div class="modal distance hidden">
        <h3>Distance from Earth</h3>
        <p>The third and perhaps most apparent hazard is, quite simply, the distance. Mars is, on average, 140 million
            miles from Earth. Rather than a three-day lunar trip, astronauts would be leaving our planet for roughly
            three years. While International Space Station expeditions serve as a rough foundation for the expected
            impact on planning logistics for such a trip, the data isn’t always comparable. If a medical event or
            emergency happens on the station, the crew can return home within hours. Additionally, cargo vehicles
            continual resupply the crews with fresh food, medical equipment, and other resources. Once you burn your
            engines for Mars, there is no turning back and no resupply.</p>
        <p>Planning and self-sufficiency are essential keys to a successful Martian mission. Facing a communication
            delay of up to 20 minutes one way and the possibility of equipment failures or a medical emergency,
            astronauts must be capable of confronting an array of situations without support from their fellow team on
            Earth.</p>
        <p class="esc">ESC TO LEAVE</p>
    </div>
    <div class="modal gravity hidden">
        <h3>Gravity (or lack thereof)</h3>
        <p>The variance of gravity that astronauts will encounter is the fourth hazard of a human mission. On Mars,
            astronauts would need to live and work in three-eighths of Earth’s gravitational pull for up to two
            years. Additionally, on the six-month trek between the planets, explorers will experience total
            weightlessness.</p>
        <p>Besides Mars and deep space there is a third gravity field that must be considered. When astronauts
            finally return home they will need to readapt many of the systems in their bodies to Earth’s gravity.
            Bones, muscles, cardiovascular system have all been impacted by years without standard gravity. To
            further complicate the problem, when astronauts transition from one gravity field to another, it’s
            usually quite an intense experience. Blasting off from the surface of a planet or a hurdling descent
            through an atmosphere is many times the force of gravity.</p>
        <p>Research is being conducted to ensure that astronauts stay healthy before, during and after their
            mission. NASA is identifying how current and future, FDA-approved osteoporosis treatments, and the
            optimal timing for such therapies could be employed to mitigate the risk for astronauts developing
            premature osteoporosis. Adaptability training programs and improving the ability to detect relevant
            sensory input are being investigated to mitigate balance control issues. Research is ongoing to
            characterize optimal exercise prescriptions for individual astronauts, as well as defining metabolic
            costs of critical mission tasks they would expect to encounter on a Mars mission.

    <div class="modal hostile hidden">
        <h3>Hostile/closed environments</h3>
        <p>A spacecraft is not only a home, it’s also a machine. NASA understands that the ecosystem inside a
            vehicle plays a big role in everyday astronaut life. Important habitability factors include temperature,
            pressure, lighting, noise, and quantity of space. It’s essential that astronauts are getting the
            requisite food, sleep and exercise needed to stay healthy and happy.</p>
        <p>Technology, as often is the case with out-of-this-world exploration, comes to the rescue in creating a
            habitable home in a harsh environment. Everything is monitored, from air quality to possible microbial
            inhabitants. Microorganisms that naturally live on your body are transferred more easily from one person
            to another in a closed environment. Astronauts, too, contribute data points via urine and blood samples,
            and can reveal valuable information about possible stressors. The occupants are also asked to provide
            feedback about their living environment, including physical impressions and sensations so that the
            evolution of spacecraft can continue addressing the needs of humans in space. Extensive recycling of
            resources we take for granted is also imperative: oxygen, water, carbon dioxide, even our waste.</p>
