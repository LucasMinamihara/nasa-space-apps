                In this project we will show one of the problems encountered during a trip to space. </p>
            <p>We will use the data collected by NASA itself and other researchers to expose one of the risks that a
                human being faces when leaving their natural habitat.</p>
            <p>Finally, explaining scientific concepts, we will show how we can overcome this challenge and how our

        <h3>Radiation</h3>
        <p>The first hazard of a human mission to Mars is also the most difficult to visualize because, well, space
            radiation is invisible to the human eye. Radiation is not only stealthy, but considered one of the most
            menacing of the five hazards.</p>
        <p>Above Earth’s natural protection, radiation exposure increases cancer risk, damages the central nervous
            system, can alter cognitive function, reduce motor function and prompt behavioral changes. To learn what can
            happen above low-Earth orbit, NASA studies how radiation affects biological samples using a ground-based
            research laboratory.</p>
        <p>The space station sits just within Earth’s protective magnetic field, so while our astronauts are exposed to
            ten-times higher radiation than on Earth, it’s still a smaller dose than what deep space has in store.</p>
        <p>To mitigate this hazard, deep space vehicles will have significant protective shielding, dosimetry, and
            alerts. Research is also being conducted in the field of medical countermeasures such as pharmaceuticals to
            help defend against radiation.</p>

        <h3>Radioprotection</h3>
        <p>The protection set of protection or preventive protection or personnel protected by radiation is protected by
            a set of protection mechanisms of protection or individualized protection by radiation.</p>
        <p>Radioactive materials and their resulting radioactivity produced have existed in outer space since the origin
            of the universe, starting to be used from sex. XIX. Radiation is the propagation of energy in the form of
            electromagnetic waves or particles. The electromagnetic wave, in turn, is a form of energy constituted by
            electric and magnetic fields, which vary and oscillate in planes perpendicular to each other, and which are
            capable of propagating in space. In a vacuum, its propagation speed is 300,000 km/s.</p>

        <h3>Panspermia</h3>
        <p>Planet Earth is the planet inhabited by us living beings. Also known
            as a water planet, it is the largest of the four rocky planets that make
            part of the Solar System. Planet Earth is known as the Blue Planet because it has
            70% of its surface covered with water. Microorganism, bacteria, is also
            found on our planet and which is highly resistant to radiation and other
            environmental risks.</p>

            Extremophiles are organisms that live in
            environments with conditions that are considered adverse to the most
            common on the planet. We tend to think that nothing would survive the conditions
            they survive, ranging from extreme temperatures and pH to high levels
            radiation and salinity. Deinococcus bacteria do not exist in
            Earth a place radioactive enough to deal with them. for supporting
            radiation doses 3,000 times greater than humans.

        <h3>Bacteria Deinococcus</h3>
        <p>A type of bacteria that is highly resistant to radiation and other environmental hazards has survived outside
            the International Space Station for three years, according to a new study.</p>
        <p>The Deinococcus bacterium is found on Earth and has been nicknamed “Conan the Bacteria” by scientists for its
            ability to survive cold, dehydration and acids.</p>
        <p>It can withstand 3,000 times the amount of radiation that would kill a human and was first isolated in meat

        <h3>Bacteria Deinococcus</h3>
        <p>A bacterium, known to be extraordinarily resistant, managed to survive outside the International Space
            Station for a year. According to the researchers, this ability to resist and adapt to adverse conditions
            provides evidence that longer and more distant journeys are possible for these organisms.</p>
        <p>The results of the research, carried out by the University of Vienna, were recently published by the journal
            Microbiome. They also reinforce the belief that these microorganisms are so resistant that they can migrate
            between planets and distribute life in the universe.</p>
        <p>"These investigations help us understand the mechanisms and processes by which life can exist outside Earth,
            expanding our knowledge of how to survive and adapt in the harsh environment of outer space," said Tetyana
            Milojevic, author of the study.</p>
